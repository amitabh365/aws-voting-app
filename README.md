# AWS Voting App

This sample creates a multi-container application in an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster. The application interface has been built using Python / Flask. The data component is using Redis.


To walk through a complete experience where this code is packaged into container images, uploaded to Elastic Container Registry, and then run in and EKS cluster, see the [AKS tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app?WT.mc_id=none-github-nepeters).
